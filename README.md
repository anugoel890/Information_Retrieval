Retrieve information in RAG technique using Sentence Transformers for creating embeddings and store in Qdrant vector database.

SentenceTransformer: The code utilizes the SentenceTransformer library with the model named 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'. This model is based on MiniLM, which is a smaller variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model architecture.

The 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model used in the code is one of the pre-trained models provided by the SentenceTransformer library. It is designed for generating fixed-size sentence embeddings from input text. These embeddings can capture semantic information from the text and are suitable for various natural language processing tasks, including similarity search.

Qdrant: Use Qdrant vector database and client library for similarity search on vector data. It provides functionality for storing vectors, performing similarity searches, and managing collections of vector data.

Code: The code primarily focuses on vectorizing wine descriptions using SentenceTransformer and then storing them in a Qdrant collection for efficient similarity search based on vector distances. It does not involve content generation using a large language model.
